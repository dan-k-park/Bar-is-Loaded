# Bar is Loaded
A trinket that renders a loaded barbell in a powerlifting competition setting.  This was made because a friend of mine recently competed in a powerlifting meet where several of her attempts were misloaded.  Mistakes such as these are potentially dangerous especially if the loading is asymmetrical or far above what it should be.
