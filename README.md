# Bar is Loaded
A trinket to visualize a barbell as it is loaded in a competition setting.  This was made because a friend of mine recently competed in a powerlifting meet where several of her attempts were carelessly misloaded.  The worst being her first attempt deadlift which was supposed to 165kg/363lbs but was loaded as 185kg/408lb.  Mistakes like these are not only psychologically deterring to a competitor, but potentially dangerous.
